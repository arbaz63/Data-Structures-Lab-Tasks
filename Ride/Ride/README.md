‚¶Å	In Joyland, the Discovery ride starts only when a good number of riders line up in the counter (say 18 riders). When the ride starts with these 18 riders, a new set of riders will line up in the counter (in queue) for next ride. This keeps continuing. Implement the above scenario of lining up and processing using arrays with Queue.
