⦁	In Joyland, the Discovery ride starts only when a good number of riders line up in the counter (say 18 riders). When the ride starts with these 18 riders, a new set of riders will line up in the counter (in queue) for next ride. This keeps continuing. Implement the above scenario of lining up and processing using arrays with Queue. ⦁	Modify it using priority queue to proceed in a way that if a VIP family comes, process them before processing others who are already waiting in the queue.
